_Warning_ not sure all of the naming convents as expressed in video are preserved. In playground `.collapsed` means only top of child view controller is visiable. `.expanded` means child view controller card is covering parent view controller almost completely. `inLabel` is the label that is visible in `.collapsed` state. `outLabel` is the label that is visible in `.expanded` state.
